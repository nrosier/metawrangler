/**
 * The theme, as React sees it.
 *
 * Two values, because they answer different questions: `mode` is what the person
 * chose (including `system`, which is not a colour), and `resolved` is the colour
 * scheme actually on screen.
 *
 * One honest limitation. `tokens.css` makes the *system* theme correct at first
 * paint with no JavaScript, so the common cases — system-light, system-dark, and an
 * explicit choice that matches the system — never flash. Someone who explicitly
 * chose light on a dark machine does see one frame of dark before this provider
 * mounts. Fixing that needs an inline script, which would require loosening CSP; a
 * frame for the minority who overrode their own system is the better trade.
